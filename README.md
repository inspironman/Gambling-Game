Slot machine Gambling Game using basics of Python and modules like random and os.

It is a gambling game using basics of python, here i used random module to spin the slot machine and used os module to clear the console screen.

The slot machine uses spin function to generate the Lucky character :
The lucky character can be either [ A  A  A ] OR [ B  B  B ] OR [ C  C  C ], any combination apart from this is unlucky and player will lose money.
